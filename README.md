the business identify the areas where it needs to make improvements. You collaborate closely with the
operations team, the support team, the marketing team, etc. and assist them in drawing conclusions
from the data they gather.
Investigating metric spikes is a crucial component of operational analytics since a data analyst needs
to be able to answer queries like, "Why is there a decline in daily engagement?" or at least help other
teams answer these questions. Why have sales decreased? Etc. Daily answers to questions like these
are required, so it is crucial to look into metric increase.
